# Order Processing System

## Overview
This project implements an Order Processing System using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and AWS Step Functions. The system handles order creation, payment processing, shipping, and sending notifications. The system processes orders sequentially through a Step Functions workflow.

## Key Features
1. **Order Creation**: The system accepts order details and generates a unique `orderId` for each order.
2. **Payment Processing**: The system validates the payment amount and updates the order status to "Paid" upon successful payment.
3. **Shipping**: The system updates the shipping status of the order once it's shipped.
4. **Notification**: The system sends a notification once the order is processed and shipping is completed.

## Architecture
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions that handle order processing tasks.
- **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrates the workflow of processing the order, including payment and shipping.
- **DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing order data.
- **API Gateway**: Exposes the endpoints for triggering the processing.

## Lambda Functions

### 1. **triggerOrderProcessing**
This function triggers the entire order processing workflow by generating a unique order ID, saving the order in DynamoDB, and starting the Step Functions workflow.

- **Endpoint**: POST `/process-order`
- **Response**: 
  - Message: `"Order processing started successfully!"`
  - Execution ARN: ARN of the Step Functions execution
  - Order ID: Unique order ID

### 2. **createOrder**
This function creates an order in DynamoDB with an initial status of "Created".

- **Inputs**: Order details (e.g., amount, customer information)
- **Outputs**: Saved order data with an added status of "Created"

### 3. **processPayment**
This function handles the payment processing. It checks if the payment amount is valid and updates the order status to "Paid".

- **Inputs**: Order data containing `orderId` and payment amount
- **Outputs**: Updated order data with the `paymentStatus` set to "Paid"

### 4. **shipOrder**
This function updates the order's shipping status to "Shipped" once the order is ready to be shipped.

- **Inputs**: Order data containing `orderId`
- **Outputs**: Updated order data with `shippingStatus` set to "Shipped"

### 5. **sendNotification**
This function simulates sending a notification once the order has been processed and shipped.

- **Inputs**: Order data containing `orderId`
- **Outputs**: A message indicating the order was processed and the notification was sent.

## Helper Functions
- **save_order**: Saves the order data to the DynamoDB table.
- **update_order**: Updates an existing order in the DynamoDB table.
- **convert_to_decimal**: Converts float values to `Decimal` to avoid issues with DynamoDB storing float values.

## Requirements
- AWS Account with permissions to create Lambda functions, Step Functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB tables.
- Python 3.x runtime for AWS Lambda.
- AWS SDK (boto3) installed for Lambda.

## Setup
1. **Create DynamoDB Table**: 
   - Table Name: `OrderTable`
   - Primary Key: `orderId` (String)

2. **Deploy Lambda Functions**: 
   Use AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) or Serverless Framework to deploy Lambda functions.

3. **Set Up API Gateway**:
   Expose the `POST /process-order` endpoint to trigger the order processing.

4. **Step Functions**:
   Ensure you have a Step Functions state machine that processes the order with the proper ARN and integrates with the Lambda functions.

## Usage
1. **Create Order**: Send a POST request to `/process-order` with order details in the request body. This will trigger the order processing workflow.

### Example Request:

```json
{
  "amount": 100.0,
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "address": "123 Street, City, Country"
}
```

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Order processing started successfully!",
  "executionArn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:718361999916:execution:OrderProcessingStateMachine-test-v2:5f1d6dff-5662-4731-8e45-862a25d2eca0",
  "orderId": "5f1d6dff-5662-4731-8e45-862a25d2eca0"
}
```

## Error Handling
- **Invalid Input**: The system checks for required fields (e.g., `orderId`, `amount`) and returns appropriate error messages if any are missing.
- **Exception Handling**: Each Lambda function includes exception handling and will return an error message if any issues occur during processing.

## Conclusion
This Order Processing System leverages AWS services to efficiently manage and process orders, payments, shipping, and notifications. It ensures the system operates in a serverless, scalable manner, leveraging AWS Step Functions to handle complex workflows.
